        	This nodes enables the filtering of VCF files based on VEP annotations.
        	The output is a VCF file containing the variants that have passed the filters.

        		This script is used to filter VEP annotations.
        		It can be found in the VEP installation in ensembl-tools-release../scripts/variant_effect_predictor.

			<option name="Select variants">
        		Choose some SO terms to define variants in which you are interested.
        		Variants that match at least one of the default terms are generally considered as Loss-of-Function variants.

        		Further filters can be defined for VCF files annotated by VEP.
        		If you want to find all high confidence LoFs having an ExAC allele frequency larger than 0.05 you would type:
        		LoF is HC,ExAC_AF>0.05 (requires the usage of the VEP plugins LOFTEE and ExAC).
