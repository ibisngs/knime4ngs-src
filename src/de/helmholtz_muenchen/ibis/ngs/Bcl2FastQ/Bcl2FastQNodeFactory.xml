        <intro>
        	Bcl2FastQ combines BCL basecall files, which are generated as primary sequencing output by Illumina sequencing instruments, and translates them into FASTQ files.
        	At the same time as converting, Bcl2FastQ also separates multiplexed samples (demultiplexing). Multiplexed sequencing allows you to run multiple individual samples, which are identified by index sequences that are were attached to the template during sample prep, in one lane. The multiplexed sample FASTQ files are assigned to projects and sample directories, based on a sample sheet.
