        <intro>
        FeatureCounts is a highly efficient general-purpose read summarizing program that counts mapped reads to genomic features such as genes, exons, promoter, gene bodies, genomic bins and chromosomal locations.
        It can be used to count both RNA-seq and genomic DNA-seq reads.<br />
        FeatureCounts takes as input SAM/BAM files and an annotation file including chromosomal coordinates of features.

        <tab name="General options">
        	<option name="Path to featureCounts binary">
        		Set the path to the compiled featureCounts binary.
        		Theoretically all versions starting from <i>1.4.3</i> should be supported.
        	</option>
			<option name="Additional parameters">
				Set parameters analogous to how you would normally use them on the command line for this binary.

        		Set the path to the GTF or SAF annotation file.

        		Set the path to the folder where the output file should be stored.

        		Choose which feature type should be used for counting in the case a GTF file is used.<br />
        		(Default: 'exon')

        	<option name="Count multimapped reads">
        		Choose whether also not uniquely mapped reads should be counted.
        	</option>
        	<option name="Perform read summarization at the feature level">
        		If specified, read summarization will be performed at the feature level (eg. exon level).
        		Otherwise, it is performed at meta-feature level (eg. gene level)
        	</option>
        	<option name="Feature type used for grouping results">
        		Specify the attribute type used to group features (eg. exons) into meta-features (eg. genes), when GTF annotation is provided.<br />
        		(Default: 'gene_id'; This attribute type is usually the gene identifier.)<br />
        		This argument is useful for the meta-feature level summarization.

        		Set the number of threads to be used. [1-16]
