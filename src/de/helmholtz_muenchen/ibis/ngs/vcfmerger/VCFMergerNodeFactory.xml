        <intro>
        	Combines VCF records from different sources using GATK's CombineVariants.
        	The tool reads in variant records from separate ROD (Reference-Ordered Data) sources and combines them into a single VCF.<br />
        	For further information, see the <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/gatkdocs/org_broadinstitute_gatk_tools_walkers_variantutils_CombineVariants.php">GATK documentation</a>.

        		This option enables to either add one single input VCF file by setting its path or several VCF files, which are located in the same folder and match the given regular expression (regex).
        		In the latter case you have to set the path to the folder.
        	</option>
        	<option name="Currently selected VCF files">
        		Selected VCF files are listed in the box and will to be merged. This option allows you to remove undesired files.

        	<option name="Genotype Merge Type"> Determine how genotype records for samples shared across the ROD file should be merged.
        		<ul>
        		<li>
        		Uniquify:
    			Make all sample genotypes unique by file.
    			Each sample shared across RODs gets named sample.ROD.
    			</li>
    			<li>
    			Prioritize:
    			Take the genotypes in priority order.

    			<li>
				Usorted:
    			Take the genotypes in any order.
    			</li>
    			<li>
				Require unique:
    			Require that all samples/genotypes be unique between all inputs.
