        <intro>
        	SubmitToQueue submits jobs started by other nodes to a queue instead of calculating them on the local computer, where knime is installed. This 
        	Node does not have in- or out ports. You simply have to connect the flow variables port of SubmitToQueue to the first node 
        	of your pipeline, that you want to run on a queue. This node might be replaced by the powerful Knime server environment.
