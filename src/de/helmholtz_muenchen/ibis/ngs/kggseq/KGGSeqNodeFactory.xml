        <intro>
        	KGGSeq is a software platform constituted of Bioinformatics and statistical genetics functions making use of valuable biologic resources and knowledge for sequencing-based genetic mapping of variants/genes responsible for human diseases/traits.Simply, KGGSeq is like a fishing rod facilitating geneticists to fish the genetic determinants of human diseases/traits in the big sea of DNA sequences. Compared with other genetic tools like plink/seq, KGGSeq paid more attention downstream analysis of genetic mapping. Currently, a comprehensive and efficient framework was newly implemented on KGGSeq to filter and prioritize genetic variants from whole exome sequencing data.<br />

        		<b>Genotype Filter</b>: Filter out variants for which their genotypes are not consistent with the assumption of disease inheritance pattern (4=Exclude variants at which both affected and unaffected subjects have the same heterozygous genotypes). For complete list see <a href="http://grass.cgs.hku.hk/limx/kggseq/doc10/UserManual.html">online KGGSeq user manual</a>.<br />
        		<b>Ignore Homo</b>: Ignore homozygous mutations <br />
        		<b>Select Gene Features</b>: Select variants by specific features: Frameshift(1), Nonframeshift(2), Startloss(3), Stopgain(4), Splicing(5), Missense(6), ...Unknown(17).

        		<b>Filter by Common variants</b>: Specify databases which are used for allele frequency filtration. <br />
        		<b>Prioritize sequence variants by disease-causing prediction</b>:  Uses dbNSFP v3.0+ database to RE-predict whether a nonsynonymous single nucleotide variant (SNV) will potentially be Mendelian disease causal or not. <br />
        		<b>Prioritize sequence variants by other genomic and OMIM annotation</b>: KGGSeq can extract all available disorder names linked to a gene in which the variants are located from the OMIM dataset morbidmap <br />
        		<b>Prioritize sequence variants by PubMed</b>: KGGSeq can mine the titles and abstracts of published papers in PubMed via the NCBI E-utilities to find a co-mention with the searched term(s) of interest. <br />	
	       		<b>Prioritize sequence variants by candidate genes with  protein interaction information</b>: Examine whether variants share the same PPIs with candidate genes. In this case, a file including the candidate gene names has to be specified. <br />	
	       		<b>Prioritize sequence variants by candidate genes with pathway information</b>: Examine whether variants share the same genesets with candidate genes. In this case, a file including the candidate gene names has to be specified. <br />
