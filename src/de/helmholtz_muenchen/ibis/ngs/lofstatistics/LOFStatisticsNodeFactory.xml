    <shortDescription>
        This node generates statistics for annotated LoF variants.
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        	This node generates tab separated statistics for annotated variants.
        	The standard statistic comprises the following fields: chr, pos, rsId (if available), ref_allele,  alt_allele.
        	Furthermore, it contains a comma separated list of affected gene ids and symbols, transcript ids and consequences.
        	Consequences are expressed using the following Sequence Ontology terms: splice_site_variant (splice_accecptor_variant, splice_donor_variant), stop_gained, frameshift_variant.
        	If a CDS file is provided, the node calculates the effect of a LoF variant.
        	In contrast to partial LoFs, full LoFs affect all transcripts of a gene.
        	Moreover, it is calculated how often each variant is observed in a homozygous/heterozygous state.
        	<br />
        	Predecessor nodes (not required): Any node that outputs a VCF file.
        </intro>
        
        <option name="Path to VCF file">
        	Select annotated VCF file.
        </option>
        <option name="Path to CDS files">
        	Select CDS file which can be downloaded here:
        	<br />
        	<a href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html">http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html</a>
        	<br />
        	If this file is not provided, the effect of LoF variants (full or partial) cannot be calculated.
        </option>
        <option name="Annotation Selection">
        	Select the tool that was used to annotate the VCF file.
        	If LOFTEE was used, the standard statistic additionally contains the fields LoF confidence, failed_filters, lof_flags and lof_infos.
