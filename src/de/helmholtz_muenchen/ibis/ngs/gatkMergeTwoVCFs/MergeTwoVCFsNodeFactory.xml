        <intro>
        This node merges two VCF files into one combined VCF file. You can for example merge the output VCL file from Pindel with the output VCF file from GATK. This combined VCF file can the be further processed by applying nodes, which filter the called variants.<br />

        <option name="Genotype Merge Type"> Determine how genotype records for samples shared across the ROD file should be merged.
        	<ul>
        	<li>Uniquify: Make all sample genotypes unique by file. Each sample shared across RODs gets named sample.ROD.</li>
    		<li>Prioritize: Take the genotypes in priority order.</li>
    		<li>Usorted: Take the genotypes in any order.</li>
    		<li>Require unique: Require that all samples/genotypes be unique between all inputs.</li>
    		<li> Prioritize input: In the case of different genotypes predicted in the two VCF files, one VCF file can be prioritized over the second.</li>
    		</ul>
    		<b>Input VCF file 1 and 2</b>: Set the paths to the vcf files that should be merged.

		<option name="Filtered Record Merge Type"> Determine how records at the same site in the VCF should be handled.
        	<ul>
        	<li>Keep if any unfiltered: Union - leaves the record if any record is unfiltered.</li>
        	<li>Keep if all unfiltered: Requires all records present at site to be unfiltered. VCF files that don't contain the record don't influence this.</li>
        	<li>Keep unconditional: If any record is present at this site (regardless of possibility being filtered), then all such records are kept and the filters are reset.</li>

        You can check this option to perform the analysis in certain genomic regions.
