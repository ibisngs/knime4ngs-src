        <intro>
        This node merges two VCF files into one combined VCF file. In this way, you can for example merge the output VCL file from Pindel with the output VCF file from GATK. This combined VCF file can the be further processed by applying nodes, which filter the called variants.

        		<b>KEEP_UNCONDITIONAL:</b>
        		If any record is present at this site (regardless of possibility being filtered), then all such records are kept and the filters are reset.

        		<b>UNIQUIFY:</b>
    			Make all sample genotypes unique by file.
    			Each sample shared across RODs gets named sample.ROD.

    			Take the genotypes in priority order.

    			Require that all samples/genotypes be unique between all inputs.

    			<b>Prioritize input:</b>
    			In the case of different genotypes predicted in the two VCF files, one VCF file can be prioritized over the second.
