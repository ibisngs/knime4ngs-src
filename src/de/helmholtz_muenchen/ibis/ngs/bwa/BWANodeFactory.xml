    	BWA - Burrows-Wheeler Alignment Tool 
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        	BWA is a fast light-weighted tool that aligns relatively short sequences (queries) to a sequence database (targe), such as the human reference genome. 
        	It implements two different algorithms, both based on Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT). The first algorithm is designed for short queries up to ~200bp 
        	with low error rate (&lt;3%). It does gapped global alignment w.r.t. queries, supports paired-end reads, and is one of the fastest short read alignment 
        	algorithms to date while also visiting suboptimal hits. The second algorithm, BWA-SW, is designed for long reads with more errors. It performs heuristic 
        	Smith-Waterman-like alignment to find high-scoring local hits (and thus chimera). On low-error short queries, BWA-SW is slower and less accurate than 
        	the first algorithm, but on long queries, it is better.<br></br>

        <option name="############### Options ###############"></option>
        <option name="BWA">Set path to executable BWA.</option>
        <option name="Reference sequence: FastA file">Choose a reference sequence, such as a genome sequence, to map the reads on (file type: FastA).</option>
        <option name="*************** Options ***************"></option>
        <option name="Index reference sequence">Uncheck this option if the reference sequence is already indexed (using bwa). In this case the reference sequence 
        		will not be indexed again.</option>
        <option name="Algorithm for constructing BWT index">Option:<ul><li>IS: IS linear-time algorithm for constructing suffix array. It requires 5.37N memory where N is 
        		the size of the database. IS is moderately fast, but does not work with database larger than 2GB. IS is the default algorithm due to its simplicity. 
        		The current codes for IS algorithm are reimplemented by Yuta Mori.</li>
        		<li>BWT-SW: Algorithm implemented in BWT-SW. This method works with the whole genome, but it does not work with database smaller than 10MB and it is usually 
        		slower than IS.</li></ul></option>
        <option name="Build color-space index">Build color-space index. The input fast should be in nucleotide space.</option>
        <option name="Type of reads/ mapping">Choose between single-end and paired-end read mapping.</option>
        <option name="Do not keep temporary files">If this option is checked all temporarily stored files, such as the index of the reference sequence or the SA
        		coordinates, will be deleted as soon as possible during the run of BWA.</option>
