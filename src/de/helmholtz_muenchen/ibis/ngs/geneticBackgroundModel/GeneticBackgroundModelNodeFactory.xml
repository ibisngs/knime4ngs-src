        <intro>
        	This node computes frequencies indicating the incidence of variants in a gene.
        	All variants in the input file that have been annotated by VEP are integrated in the computation of gene-based variant frequencies.
        	The frequencies can be computed based on genotypes or allele counts/numbers (if genotypes are not available).
      		These frequencies can be used as a background model for the analysis of case-control studies.
