    <shortDescription>
        Node for filtering reads from a fastq/fasta file
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
          Node for the tool RawReadManipulator (written by Jonathan Hoser) to filter reads from a fastq or fasta file.
          Creates new fastq/fasta file in the same directory.
        </intro>
        
        
      <!--<option name="Read file">Path to read file in fastq or fasta format</option> -->
      <!--  <option name="2nd read file">In case of paired-end reads, specify a second read file in fastq or fasta format</option> -->
        <option name="Use filter-settings calculated by FastQC (in-port)"> use filter-settings file generated by FastQC coming from the in-port</option>
        <option name="Spcecify own filter-settings file">select a previously generated filter-settings file as generated by the FastQC node</option>
        <option name="Barcode file">search reads for barcodes (start only) - with barcodes specified in the BARCODEFILE<br></br>
    		format:<pre>ID	BARCODE(line End)</pre><br></br>A '#' marks a commentline;</option>
        <option name="*************** Parameters ***************"></option>
        <option name="Remove adapters"> remove adapters from reads (start and end only)- with adapters specified in a
    comma-separated list (e.g "CAGGTACG,CATTTTAG,AAATTGGAC")</option>
    	<option name="Trim 3'/5' Poly-A/T prefixes"> (can be covered by filtersettings), if present reads are trimmed of PolyA/T prefixes/tails,
    depending on the 5/3 option: 3 will trim 3'-polyA/T, 5 the 5'-polyA/T prefixes.</option>
        <option name="Set min. avg. quality"> If average Readquality (mean over all single read-bases quality) is below this threshold X we are to discard this read. Paying attention to potential pairs.
        </option>
   		<option name="Trim reads by quality"> trim reads from the right until quality value above threshold Y is encountered.</option>
   		<option name="Also trim from left"> reads are trimmed from both sides applying the threshold set in "Trim reads by quality"</option>
   		<option name="Reads containing Ns">remove reads containing Ns</option>
   		<option name="Keep single ends?">In case of paired-end datasets: If set to "Yes", we keep single ends (separatly) if the partner is discarded.</option>
		<option name="Discard reads shorter than a given length">If after all trimming operations a read is shorter than Z, discard it.
		</option>
		<option name="Choose quality encoding">In case of Illumina data: if known, specify the quality encoding.
    If set to "auto", we will try to make an educated guess.</option>
		<option name="Convert quality to phred-based qualities">Only possible in case of Illumina data. Quality encoding will be converted to phred encoding</option>
		<option name="Number of threads to use">Specify how many threads should be used</option>
