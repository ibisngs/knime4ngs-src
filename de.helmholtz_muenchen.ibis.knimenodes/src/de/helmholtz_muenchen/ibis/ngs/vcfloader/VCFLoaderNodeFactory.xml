        Node for loading VCF files
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        	VCFLoader loads up to two VCF files containing SNPs, insertions, deletions or insertions+deletions (indels).
        	It is not possible to load two VCF files with the same type of variants in one node instance.
        	This node is designed to load the results from Pindel or GATKUnifiedGenotyper, but it can be used for VCF files from other sources as well.

        <option name="VCF file">
        	Set path to the first VCF file 
    	</option>
        <option name="Variant type">
        	Select the mutation type for the variants in the file.
        	You can choose between SNPs, insertions, deletions and indels (insertions and deletions in the same file).
    	</option>
        <option name="Second variant file">
        	If you want to load a second file, tick the option <i> Load second VCF file </i> and set the path and variant type of the VCF file.

        	The outport consists of at most 2 columns. The column names depend on variant type selection.
        	In the following  lines the string VAR has to be replaced by snp, indel, insertions or deletions according to the variant type.
